roon-cpulimit
===

Runs `cpulimit` on your Roon.exe process when you're not focused on the application.

See https://community.roonlabs.com/t/high-cpu-usage-of-remote-in-wine-since-build-903-some-affected-users-but-apparently-not-everyone/189074 for a very long and unfruitful thread about this.

Requires:
 * roon in Wine (obviously)
 * i3
 * a rust toolchain
